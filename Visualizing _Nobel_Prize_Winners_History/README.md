What decade had the highest proportion of US-born winners? Store this as an integer called max_decade_usa.
What decade and category pair had the highest proportion of female laureates? Store this as a dictionary called max_female_dict where the decade is the key and the category is the value.
Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category? Save your string answers as first_woman_name and first_woman_category.
Which individuals or organizations have won multiple Nobel Prizes throughout the years? Store the full names in a list named repeat_list.
