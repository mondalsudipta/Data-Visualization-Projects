**This project is a part of DataCamp's certification tracks (Data Scientist with Python and Data Analyst with Python).**

The following are the project tasks:

Analyze Nobel Prize winner data and identify patterns by answering the following questions:

1. What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country? Storing the string answers as top_gender and top_country.
2. What decade had the highest proportion of US-born winners? Store this as an integer called max_decade_usa.
3. What decade and category pair had the highest proportion of female laureates? Store this as a dictionary called max_female_dict where the decade is the key and the category is the value.
4. Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category? Save your string answers as first_woman_name and first_woman_category.
5. Which individuals or organizations have won multiple Nobel Prizes throughout the years? Store the full names in a list named repeat_list.
